# Netflix_Data_Analysis_and_Visualisation

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project exploring Netflix’s content strategy using Python. The project uncovers key trends in movie/TV show releases, genre popularity, director influence, and predictive modeling to understand Netflix’s global dominance in streaming.

## Key Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Trends in release years, monthly drops, and country-wise content distribution.

* Data Visualization – Interactive plots (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for genre frequency, runtime distribution, and director impact.

* Machine Learning Models – ARIMA forecasting for future releases (with limitations & improvement scope).

---

## **Key Findings**  

* **TV Shows > Movies**: Post-2018, series dominated (~60% of new releases).  

*  **Top Genres**: *International Movies, Dramas, Comedies*—reflecting global demand.  

* **Director Insights**: **Rajiv Chilaka (kids’ content)** had more releases than **Scorsese/Spielberg combined**!  

* **Runtime Trends**: Most films are **90-120 mins**, optimized for streaming.
